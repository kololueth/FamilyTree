# FamilyTree

A mobile phone app used to view family trees using XML as a data storage.  
You add yourself, your mother, and your father to the application and then you can start adding other family members to your tree.  
When viewing family members, you swipe left or right to view you siblings object and you swipe up to see the next 
generation (children, nieces, nephews) and you swipe down to view the previous generation (parents, aunt, uncles).
